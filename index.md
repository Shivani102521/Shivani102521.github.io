I could not stop wasting my time.
I planned thousands of things, started most of them but left it midway.
I wanted to do a lot of things but I use to work so hard on my job that I used to be tired by the time I was back.
I always want to give my best and want to find perfection in everything I do.
I kept telling myself that I am feeling tired. I am not getting time/ not able to plan things porperly and use to go to sleep.
I felt sad about it. It was crazy.
However I read something that made a lot of sense to me: Working hard on your job can make you a living but if you work hard on yourself you will make fortune.
Hence, here I am. I don't want to change me as working hard is not wrong but I know that I have to work hard on myslef as well as daily target/monthly report/ appraisals/performance report.
